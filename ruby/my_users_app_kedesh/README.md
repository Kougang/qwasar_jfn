# Welcome to My Users App
***

## Task

The project consists of making a web application where users have the possibility to register, connect, delete or update their data.

## Description

Firstly, we had to create a model that would allow us to create users 
and then do the various necessary actions such as: adding a new user to the database, 
displaying it, updating it and deleting it. . Secondly, it was necessary to create endpoints allowing actions to be controlled in relation to user requests.

## Installation

No need for installation, you just have to start the server then start making our requests.

## Usage

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
